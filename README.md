# Caesar Cipher Auto Decoding

This repository contains a program that automatically decodes Caesar cipher encoded strings by identifying the number of shifts used to encode the message. The program is designed to take in an encoded string and output the decoded message, providing a simple and efficient way to decode Caesar cipher messages without the need to manually try different shift values.
